We propose a dual-particle approach to deal with tensile instability in particle methods in fluid simulation, which involves incorporating supplementary virtual particles designed to capture and store particle pressures. Our approach can accurately simulate free-surface flows with rich small-scale thin features, such as droplets, streamlines, and sheets.
