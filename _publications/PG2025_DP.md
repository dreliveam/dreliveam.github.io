<p style="text-align: justify;">
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a classical and popular method for fluid simulation, yet it is inherently susceptible to instabilities under tension or compression, which leads to significant visual artifacts.
To overcome the limitation, an adaptive particle fission-fusion approach is proposed within the Dual-particle SPH framework. Specifically, in tension-dominant regions (e.g., fluid splashing), the velocity and pressure calculation points are decoupled to enhance tension stability, while in compression-dominant regions (e.g., fluid interiors),  the velocity and pressure points are colocated to preserve compression stability. This adaptive configuration, together with modifications to the Dual-particle projection solver, allows for a unified treatment of fluid behavior across different stress regimes. Additionally, due to the reduced number of virtual particles and an optimized solver initialization, the proposed method achieves significant performance improvements compared to the original Dual-particle SPH method.
